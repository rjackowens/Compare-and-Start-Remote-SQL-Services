# Compare and Start Remote SQL Services

This is a script that allows you to save current SQL services status across multiple servers as a master template and then compare and/or start these services at a later point. The script saves an Excel copy of the master and current lists to C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents by default for easy reference and export.

## **Features**

- Create an Excel master and current spreadsheet of SQL services status across multiple servers
- Automatically starts services that differ from the master template (upon user confirmation)

## **Getting Started**

Clone all files from the GitHub repository. Edit the $ServersOutput -filter parameter with a list of the SQL servers you wish to query.

## **Compatibility**

The software has been tested on Windows 7 x64 and Windows 10 x64.
